    		<h1>Step by Step Guide</h1>

<p>Final Cut Pro X (FCPX) is maybe the best and more affordable solution to work with video at a professional level.<br/>
You won’t get better results by using any other solution out there, you have all you need right there.</p>

<p>There are many tutorials around, you can check them on the web and many of them are for free.<br/>
FCPX, of course, has a very extensive documentation and you can always find support on the web.</p>

<p>This is a very specific and short guide to import an XML file. You should at least take a look at the “Interface Overview”<br/>
in the FCP X Help to properly follow this guide.</p>

<p>1-Open FCPX.</p>

<p>2-Make sure to open a Library to work with and select it. <br/>
If you haven’t opened a Library yet, select “File” from the Menu bar (top of the screen) and then “Open Library”.<br/>
If this option is not available, create a new Library. On the Menu bar, select “File” > “New” > “Library.”</p>

<p>3-Once you have a selected Library to work with, go to the menu bar and select “File” > “Import” > “XML.”<br/>
A file browser will pop up. Select your XML file, which should have a .fcpxml extension, and click on “Import.”</p>

<p>4.-An Event and a Project with the names you gave them on step 1 will be imported into your Library.<br/>
Imports can take long, so be patient. For example, if you import one thousand subtitles, it can take up to 5 minutes to import.<br/>
It’s a lot of information to process, but you will be saving yourself a lot of work.</p>

<p>5-Make sure your recently imported Event is selected so you can see the project with the subtitle layback.<br/>
Double-click on the Project’s name to open its timeline. Preparation of the display will take a few seconds,<br/>
after which you will be able to see a timeline with your subtitles ready to run.</p>

<p>6.-If you haven’t imported your video yet, drag it from Finder to your Event window or to your Event name on the Libraries window.<br/>
You can also select “File” > “Import” > “Media” from the Menu Bar or press cmd + i.<br/>
7.-On the bottom part of your Project’s timeline, below the subtitles, you will see a black bar,<br/>
which will be replaced by your video. Drag your video over this bar until it is highlighted.<br/>
Drop it and you will see a context menu. Select “Replace".</p>

<p>You can also drop your video under this black bar, but make sure it starts right at the beginning of the timeline.<br/>
Now you can select and delete the black bar.</p>

<p>8.-Your subtitle layback is ready. You can now play it by selecting the playhead on the timeline and hit the space bar.<br/>
Now make sure that you used the right timecode by spotting your video and checking that your subtitles are still synced.<br/>
If they’re not, assuming that the source timing is right, you may want to make an adjustment on step 3 > option 1<br/>
by applying a correction factor.</p>

<p>9.-Once your QC is done, you are ready to export your video with Compressor.</p>
