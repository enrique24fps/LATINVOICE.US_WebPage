    		<h1>Guidelines adopted by SUBTITLES TO FCPXML</h1>

<p>Two is the maximum amount of lines per subtitle. Three or more lines are not supported.</p>

<p>To use italics, raiseds and forceds properly, there is a group of characters that won&rsquo;t be used as text<br/>
and will be reserved exclusively to set up these commands, which are:</p>

<p>• &ldquo;{&rdquo; for forceds,<br/>
• &ldquo;}&rdquo; for raiseds,<br/>
• and &ldquo;[ ]&rdquo; or &ldquo;( )&rdquo; for italics.</p>

<p>These characters won&rsquo;t be displayed in your layback.</p>

<h2>Italics</h2>

<p>Italics can be defined through either brackets &ldquo;[ ]&rdquo; or curved brackets, aka parentheses, &ldquo;( )&rdquo;.<br/>
Whichever you choose, they must remain the same throughout the entire file,<br/>
since the alternative can be used for other purposes, such as character IDs or sound effect tags,<br/>
and will be displayed as characters in the layback.</p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve decided which brackets to use, go to Step 3 and select it <br/>
in the drop down menu before you generate the XML file.</p>

<h2>Raiseds</h2>

<p>SUBTITLES TO FCPXML uses two vertical positions to properly display the subtitles.<br/>
Subtitles are by default displayed on the bottom of the screen.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t want a subtitle to block the image at the bottom of the screen,<br/>
raise the subtitle to the top of the screen. To do so, write &ldquo;}&rdquo; at the beginning of your subtitle.</p>

<h2>Forceds</h2>

<p>A &ldquo;forced&rdquo; subtitle is one that is not dialogue or is dialogue in a language different from the rest of the film.<br/>
To mark a subtitle as a &ldquo;forced&rdquo; subtitle, write &ldquo;{&rdquo; at the beginning of the subtitle.</p>

<p>In Step 4 you can select to only layback forced subtitles.<br/>
The forced subtitle command character will never be displayed in your subtitle layback.</p>

<h1>Recommended practices when preparing subtitles.</h1>

<h2>Recommended use of italics:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Album, book, film and program titles (use quotes for song titles).</li>
<li>Foreign words (unless they are part of regular usage).</li>
<li>Dialogue that is heard through electronic media, such as a phone, television, or computer.</li>
<li>Only use italics when the speaker is not in the scene(s), not merely off screen or off camera.</li>
<li>Song lyrics (if rights have been granted) o Voice-overs</li>
</ul>


<p>Do not use italics to indicate emphasis on specific words.</p>

<h2>Recommended use of raiseds</h2>

<p>Do not alternate between raiseds and bottom-row subtitles.<br/>
Once you start using raiseds, keep going until they are no longer needed in the scene.</p>

<h2>Recommended use of forced subtitles</h2>

<p>It is good practice to mark forced subtitles because oftentimes dialogue in a language different<br/>
from the rest of the film is translated into the main one, or because it&rsquo;s the native language of the target audience<br/>
and therefore doesn&rsquo;t need to be subtitled.</p>

<ul>
<li>Forced narrative titles should only be included if plot pertinent.</li>
<li>Forced narratives that are redundant (e.g., identical to onscreen text or covered in the dialogue) must be deleted.</li>
<li>Forced narratives should be in ALL CAPS, except for written passages (e.g., excerpts from books,<br/>
magazines or newspapers, handwritten notes, social media messages and text messages),<br/>
which must match the use of uppercase/lowercase as it appears on screen.<br/>
In order to improve readability, mixed case can also be used for long passages of on screen text<br/>
(e.g., long written passages used as prologue or epilogue).</li>
<li>Never combine a forced narrative with dialogue in the same subtitle.</li>
<li>When a forced narrative interrupts dialogue, use an ellipsis at the end of the sentence in the<br/>
subtitle that precedes it and at the beginning of the sentence in the subtitle that follows it.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Other good practices</h2>

<ul>
<li>Always spell check your subtitles.</li>
<li>Be as precise as possible when timming subtitles.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t make subtitles with very long duration (more then 7 seconds)<br/>
or very short duration (less than a second).</li>
</ul>


<p>Make a character limitation<br/>
-Common character per line are: 32, 38 and 42.</p>

<p>Use of dual Speakers<br/>
- Use a hyphen followed by a space to indicate two speakers in one subtitle, with a maximum of one speaker per line.</p>

<p>Reading Speed<br/>
- Adult programs: 200 words per minute / 17 characters per second<br/>
- Children’s programs: 160 words per minute / 13 characters per second</p>

<p>Repetitions<br/>
- Do not translate words or phrases repeated more than once.<br/>
- If the repeated word or phrase is said twice in a row, time subtitle to the audio but translate only once.</p>

<p>Foreign Dialogue<br/>
- Foreign dialogue should only be translated if the viewer was meant to understand it (i.e., if it was subtitled in the original version).<br/>
- When using foreign words, always verify spelling, accents and punctuation, if applicable.<br/>
- Foreign words should be italicized, unless they have become part of regular usage<br/>
(e.g., in English, the following no longer need to be italicized: bon appétit, rendezvous, doppelgänger, zeitgeist, persona non grata)<br/>
and unless they are proper names (e.g., a company name).</p>

<h1>Format examples</h1>

<p>STL EBU is a binary language so it&rsquo;s impractical to include an example of it.</p>

<p>TXT is one or two lines of text followed by the in and out times of the subtitle.<br/>
Italics are usually marked with brackets &ldquo;[ ]&rdquo;, raiseds with &ldquo;{&rdquo;, and forceds with &ldquo;{&rdquo;.<br/>
If you wish to mark italics with parentheses &ldquo;( )&rdquo;, SUBTITLES TO FCPXML allows you to do that.</p>

<p>In an SRT file, the first line indicates the subtitle number; the second line displays its in and out times;<br/>
and the subsequent lines are the lines of text of the subtitle.<br/>
(The format supports up to three lines of text, but SUBTITLES TO FCPXML only supports two).<br/>
The last line is empty and serves as a separation between subtitles.</p>
